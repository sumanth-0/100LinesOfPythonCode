# Fruits Collecting Game

## Description
Fruits Collecting Game is a simple arcade-style game built with Python and Pygame.  
Colorful fruits fall from the top of the screen, and you control a basket at the bottom to catch them.  
Move the basket left and right using arrow keys to catch fruits, earn points, and avoid missing them.  
The game gets progressively harder as fruits fall faster and spawn more frequently. Lose all your lives, and it's game over!
