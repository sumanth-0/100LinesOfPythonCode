> A lightweight Python utility to rename all images in a folder sequentially with a custom prefix.

## Features

* **Automatic renaming** of all image files in a folder
* **Custom prefix support** (e.g., `photo_1.jpg`, `photo_2.png`, etc.)
* **Preserves file extensions** correctly
* **Alphabetical renaming order** for predictable results

## ðŸ§  Usage

### 1. Clone or Download the Script

Download the file **`rename_images.py`** to your computer.

### 2. Run the Script

In your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the scriptâ€™s folder and run:

```bash
python rename_images.py
```

### 3. Provide Input

Youâ€™ll be prompted to enter:

1. The **folder path** containing your images
2. The **prefix** for renamed files

Example session:

```
Enter the folder path containing images: /Users/deepak/Pictures/Vacation
Enter the prefix for renamed images: beach
```

Output:

```
Renamed: imgA.jpg â†’ beach_1.jpg

Renaming completed successfully!

## Notes & Tips

* The script **renames files in-place**, so make a **backup** if needed.
* Files are renamed **alphabetically** (not by creation date).
* Ensure you have **write permissions** in the target directory.
* Non-image files are **ignored** safely.

---

## Requirements

* **Python 3.6+**
* No third-party libraries required â€” uses the built-in `os` module.
