\# Firefly Synchronization Simulation ðŸŒŒ



This Python script creates a beautiful simulation of glowing, floating lights that resemble fireflies moving across the screen. Each "firefly" moves independently with a soft glowing effect and fades over time before respawning at a new location.



\## How It Works



* Each firefly is represented as a particle with random position, color, transparency, and movement.
* The brightness (alpha) of each firefly gradually fades as it moves.
* When a firefly fades out or moves off-screen, it respawns at a random location.
* The animation runs continuously until you press q to quit.



\## Requirements



* Make sure you have Python and OpenCV installed.
  pip install opencv-python numpy



\## How to Run



* Save the script as firefly\_simulation.py
* Run it in your terminal:
  python firefly\_simulation.py
* A window titled "Fireflies" will open.
* Press q to exit the simulation.



\### Customization



You can tweak parameters to change the look and behavior:



* Canvas size: change (800, 800)
* Particle count: adjust the range in particles = \[particle() for \_ in range(random.randint(100, 200))]
* Speed and color: modify ranges in the reset() method.
