# Random Art Collage Generator

A Python program that automatically generates **abstract digital art** by combining **random shapes, colors, and text** onto a canvas.

Each time you run the program, it produces a **unique artwork** — no two pieces are ever the same.  
It’s a fun creative coding experiment that blends randomness with generative art.
