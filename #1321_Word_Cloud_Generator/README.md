# ☁️ Word Cloud Generator (Python)

A simple **Python script** that generates a beautiful **word cloud** image from any block of text.  
It visualizes the most frequent words in a text, making it an easy and fun way to analyze or present textual data.

## 📋 Overview

This project uses the `WordCloud` and `matplotlib` libraries to transform text into a **visual frequency map** — where word size represents importance or occurrence.  
You can enter your own text interactively, or use the built-in example text to generate an instant word cloud.

The generated image is displayed in a window and also saved as a `.png` file in your current directory.
