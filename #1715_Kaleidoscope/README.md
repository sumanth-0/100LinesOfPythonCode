# üåÄ Python Kaleidoscope

A mesmerizing interactive **kaleidoscope drawing app** built with **Pygame**.  
Move your mouse to draw, and watch your strokes repeat symmetrically to create beautiful geometric patterns!

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-time drawing:** Click and drag your mouse to draw lines.
- **Kaleidoscopic symmetry:** Your strokes are mirrored and rotated into multiple symmetric wedges.
- **Color cycling:** The hue smoothly shifts as you draw, creating vivid rainbow trails.
- **Dynamic clearing:** Press **`C`** to clear the canvas and start over.
- **Simple controls:** Easy to play with and tweak symmetry or colors.

## üß† How It Works

The screen is divided into several symmetric wedges (default: **6**).  
Each stroke you draw is mirrored and rotated across these wedges to simulate a kaleidoscope effect.

Core ideas:
- The drawing is relative to the **center of the screen**.
- Each stroke is rotated using `math.cos()` and `math.sin()` transformations.
- Mirrored copies are drawn by inverting the y-coordinate.
- The **HSL color space** is used to smoothly cycle through hues while drawing.
