# Turtle Spirograph Art Generator

This is a simple Python script that uses the built-in `turtle` module to draw a beautiful, colorful spirograph-style rosette.

## Description

The script opens a new graphics window and uses a turtle (a cursor) to draw a series of 36 overlapping circles. Each circle is drawn in a different random color from a predefined palette. By tilting the turtle 10 degrees after each circle, it creates a complex, symmetrical, and beautiful geometric pattern.

## Features

* Generates unique, colorful art every time.
* Uses a black background to make the colors pop.
* Shows a visual process as it draws.
* Finishes in just a few seconds.

## How to Run

1.  Ensure you have Python 3 installed (which includes the `turtle` module).
2.  Run the script from your terminal:
    ```sh
    python spirograph_art.py
    ```
3.  A new window will open and begin drawing.
4.  Once finished, simply **click the window** to close it.
