- **üí™ Keep Practicing**: Below the above thresholds

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Terminal with ANSI color support (most modern terminals)

## Technical Details

### WPM Calculation

The game uses the standard formula for calculating Words Per Minute:
- 1 word = 5 characters (industry standard)
- WPM = (characters typed / 5) / (time in minutes)

### Accuracy Calculation

Accuracy is calculated as:
- Percentage of correctly typed characters compared to the original text
- Accuracy = (correct characters / total characters) √ó 100

## Controls

- **ENTER**: Start typing or submit your typed text
- **Ctrl+C**: Exit the game at any time
- **y/n**: Choose to play again after each round

## Code Structure

The game is organized into several key functions:

- `clear_screen()`: Clears the terminal display
- `print_banner()`: Displays the game title and branding
- `calculate_wpm()`: Computes typing speed
- `calculate_accuracy()`: Computes typing accuracy
- `get_difficulty()`: Handles difficulty selection
- `play_game()`: Main game logic
- `display_results()`: Shows performance metrics
- `main()`: Game loop and flow control

## Tips for Improvement

1. **Focus on Accuracy First**: Speed will naturally improve with accuracy
2. **Use Proper Posture**: Sit upright with feet flat on the floor
3. **Position Your Hands**: Keep your fingers on the home row (ASDF JKL;)
4. **Don't Look at the Keyboard**: Train yourself to touch type
5. **Practice Regularly**: Consistency is key to improvement
6. **Start with Easy Level**: Build confidence before moving to harder levels
